# supplemental_mta_modules
This repo is a set of mta supplemental modules commonly used in scripts in different areas of the codebase.

Convention is to locate these modules in a python-version-named folder on the /data/mta or /data/mta4 disks.

eg.
- /data/mta4/Script/Python3.10/MTA/
- /data/mta/Script/Python3.10/MTA/

These are typically manually included file copies inside an existing conda environment.
